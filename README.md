This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the catch-all route `/*` in React Router v6. The problem arises when the catch-all route fails to handle requests that do not match any other defined routes. This is usually due to incorrect route order or conflicts with other routes.  The solution involves careful route ordering and potentially using path parameters for more controlled behavior.
